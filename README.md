Hi there! My name is Josh Gaughan and am a graduate student at Indiana University Indianapolis. I am currently studying applied data science with a specialization in sports analytics. This github page is a centralized location for all of the projects I have worked on. They are available to the public and can be viewed, downloaded at any time.

Public, Google Colab, PDFs).
- Highlights your key technical skills (Python, R, SQL, Tableau, Azure, etc.).
- Includes contact info (email or LinkedIn)
